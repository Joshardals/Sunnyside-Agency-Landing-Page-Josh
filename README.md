## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Grid perfectly well without the use of external frameworks like Bootstrap, e.t.c. 

I know what flexbox is tho. But in general, this project made me more comfortable with flexbox and it was like a challenge to test my flexbox skills. Now I can consider myself as a flexbox King. LOL 

I also learnt new tricks about mobile responsive design as well.  


### Continued development

What next after this project? I will like to continue focusing on building more web apps with Next JS or React JS and also how to interact with third party web api as well.
